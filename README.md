use navigator (forms - trainers - Create/Read/Edit) or the helping linkbar on the right!
try to login/logout/signup with the top-right buttons!
in order to edit trainers, you need to be a moderator .. sign up as moderator or just login if you are one already!
home and login/logout/signup paths are all included in the same "trainerapp" application just for this assignment.
only home, navigator/linkbar CRE and login/logout/signup buttons are functional in this project.
